Texas continues to be an economic growth driver for the nation, and as of April 2019 had added 294,200 nonfarm payroll employment positions over the year before - more than any other state. Every employment category tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) saw increases over the prior twelve-month period - with the notable exception of Information category jobs, which were down statewide by 0.7% (approximately 1,400 positions) over the year before, even as nationwide employment in this field increased. 

In this project, we applied machine learning to consider the past several years of Texas workforce data project the 2019 trend for by sector and relative sector job growth across different metropolitan areas and regions of Texas. We also utilized the popular dashboarding software Tableau to create a final product that is attractive, interactable, and easy to use and understand for non-specialists.
